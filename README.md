11. Euclidâ€™s game (see [Bog]) starts with two unequal positive integers on the
board. Two players move in turn. On each move, a player has to write on
the board a positive number equal to the difference of two numbers already
on the board; this number must be new, i.e., different from all the numbers
already on the board. The player who cannot move loses the game. Should
you choose to move first or second in this game?
